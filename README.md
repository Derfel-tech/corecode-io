## Week challenges (Tuesday) ðŸ’»
### 1.Search and answer the question: Java language is compiled or interpreted?
Java is considered both since it is first compiled into binary code and then the code runs in the Java VM which is usually software-based
### 2. Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currency to USD
```
1. declare variable USD set to 35.4
2. input value in NIO
3. multiply USD value by NIO
4. print result given
```
### 3.Answer to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful?
because it helps with the abstraction of the process that the code can follow, and then it can be translated into any language
### 4.Create a pseudocode to calculate the approximated age of a user base on the year they were born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example I could define Y <-- 2022)
```
1. define currentY as 2022
2. input year user was born as bornY
3. substract currentY - bornY as result
4. print result
```
### 5.Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?
They are a useful way to explain your code to other programmers and what you pretend it to do. Also, it works as the first step to define how you want the process to go because it can give you some perspective and help you travel through the code easily.
### 6. Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages, you can start with this video
* a high level language is user oriented, so it makes easier to convert and algorithm to code 
* a low level language is machine-oriented, so you need to be more specific in therms of capabilities and specifications, they are also known as assembly language

### 1. Learn about binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbers
### 2. Translate the year you were born to binary, decimal and hexadecimal
The year I was born  can be translated as:
* decimal: 1998
* binary: 11111001110
* hexadecimal: 7CE
### 3. Translate 51966 into hexadecimal and binary
* binary: 1100101011111110
*  hexadecimal: CAFE > hahaha, really loved the Easter egg
### 4. Use a Low-level language, for example MIPS assembler, to do so, you will need to follow [this](resources/MIPS.md) guide. We recommend checking the guide first but also [this](https://courses.cs.vt.edu/cs2506/Fall2014/Notes/L04.MIPSAssemblyOverview.pdf) presentation could be helpful.
### 5. Base on the examples and the guide of the low-level language:
   5.1 Create a program to add two numbers given by the user
```
.data
msg1: .asciiz "Enter the first number: "
msg2: .asciiz "\nEnter the second number: "
result: .asciiz "\nThe result is: "

.text
li $v0,4
la $a0,msg1
syscall

li $v0,5
syscall
move $t1,$v0

li $v0,4
la $a0,msg2
syscall

li $v0,5
syscall
move $t2,$v0

Add $t3,$t1,$t2

li $v0,4
la $a0,msg3
syscall

li $v0,1
move $a0,$t3
syscall

li $v0,10
syscall
```
   5.2 Create a program that display your name
``` 
# create string
.data
str:  .asciiz "\nMy name is Walter G!\n"

.text
.globl main

main:
la $a0, str
li $v0, 4

# end the program
syscall
li $v0, 0
jr $ra
```
## Week challenges (Thursday) ðŸ’»

### 1. Search for real word applications of Javascript
You can use Javascript for the following applications: <br>
1. Web development: you can use it to create functions and webpages
2. Server applications: with NodeJS you can create fast and scalable applications
3. Web servers: with NodeJS a web server can be created. These servers are very fast and do not use buffering
### 2. (optional but great) Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW6vQNE2jgc&t=1962s) video
### 3. (optional but great) Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXkQJBASUOg) video
### 4. Follow the GitHub course

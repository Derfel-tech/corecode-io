# HTML & Node - Week 8

## Week goal 🏁

The purpose of this week is to create a webpage with multiple functions involving Javascript, CSS and HTML. To avoid creating multiple links I am using one central webpage with subpages for each excercise.

If you want to take a look at the webpage just click on the link below <br>
